# Prefix-Easy
A (hopefully) well written site to act as my personal portfolio  
## Story
I was originally planning on writing the entire site in raw HTML, CSS, Js but have since decided to move to a React/TypeScript platform to make advanced features much easier to implement and to be more in line with what industry might demand.

Honestly I'd rather this just be something that I build for fun now, more of a blog for a few photo albums to live on. Also keen to try out some SVG graphics and animations for the home page
